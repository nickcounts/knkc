# knkc

This repository contains my self-study of the C programming language.
I am working though the `K N King` book `C Programming: A Modern Approach`.

All in-chapter exercises will be completed and saved as `ex##.c`, while the
end-of-chapter problems will be saved as `proj##.c`. Source code is currently
organized by chapter.

## Building the exercises and projects

I will be maintaining chapter-specific makefiles as I work through the book.
To build any of the projects, you should be able to execute `make proj10`
from within a chapter directory and build to executable. Run the exercise by
`./proj10`

Early chapters did not include an `all` target, but I have included `all`
since chapter 6. (Perhaps I will go back and add to earlier chapters)

To build the entire chapter, you should be able to use `make all` and to clean
up all the executables and the debugger symbol link directories, use
`make clean`

# Debugging on MacOS w/ clang

I have had luck using `lldb`, the pre-installed debugger

```zsh
lldb ./ex4
Current executable set to '/Users/nick/Developer/c/knkc/ch11/ex4' (arm64).
(lldb) breakpoint set --file ex4.c --line 14
Breakpoint 1: where = ex4`swap + 12 at ex4.c:14:15, address = 0x000000010000046c
(lldb) run
Process 69513 launched: '/Users/nick/Developer/c/knkc/ch11/ex4' (arm64)

   13   void swap(int *p, int *q) {

   15     if (DEBUG) {
   16       printf("In swap()\n");
   17       printf("swap(%p, %p)\n", p, q);
